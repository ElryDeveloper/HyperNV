# HyprNV Dotfiles
A Hyperland Configuration based on Hyperdots (Using Nvidia)

## Usage
Install Hyprdots (Skip the Flatpak)
Edit the monitors.conf and hyprpaper.conf in /Dotfiles/hypr of the project, according to the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/).

Now Simply run the install.sh (without root) and everything else should happen automatically.

## Info
This was made for myself, so this is made with my Setup in mind and provided as is.

If youre running more then 2 Monitors, you need to reconfigure the Wallpapers.

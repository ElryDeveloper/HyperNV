# HyperNV
A Hyperland Configuration based on Hyperdots (Using Nvidia)

## Usage
Edit the monitors.conf file according to the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/) for your Monitor Setup.
Now Simply run the install.sh (without root) and everything else should happen automatically.

## Info
This was made for myself, so this is made with my Setup in mind and provided as is.
If youre running more then 2 Monitors, you need to reconfigure the Wallpapers.

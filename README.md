# HyprNV Dotfiles
A Hyperland Configuration based on Hyperdots (Using Nvidia)
This repo is Archived in Favor of my Hyprland based OS.
This is used as a Configurationbase for my [HyprOS](https://github.com/ElryDeveloper/HyprOS) and this repo wont be updated anymore, if you want to use my Configuration you have to use HyprOS.

## Usage (Not Recommended)
Install [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/) (Skip the Flatpak)

Clone this repo.

Edit the monitors.conf and hyprpaper.conf in /Dotfiles/hypr of the project.

Now Simply run the install.sh (without root) and everything else should happen automatically.
